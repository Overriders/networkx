    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    weight: string, optional (default='weight')
        Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.

    Returns
    -------
    A dictionary which keys are the nodes of the Graph and its values are the
    communities that they belong

    Notes
    -----
    The Louvain Method for community detection is a method to extract
    communities from large networks created by Vincent Blondel. The method is
    a greedy optimization method that appears to run in time O(n log n).

    Implementation follows algorithm described at paper below:
